### Hangouts Meet (enterprise version of Hangouts, did two separate so we can hear each other)

I'd recommend changing the video quality to 720p in the bottom right settings menu when you start each video feed as the defaults have been changed to 360p recently.

After a donation from Kyle and a Steam sale, we now have all 6 packs

### Extension

Meet has a Grid view by default, but I'd still recommend this Google Meet Grid View Extension for Chrome/Edge Beta

Shows everyone in chat in Grid view by Default
